# 2. Context and Background

**Aruba is a small Caribbean island located in the southern part of the Caribbean Sea.** It is situated about 29 kilometers (18 miles) north of the coast of Venezuela, making it part of the Lesser Antilles. Aruba is one of the four constituent countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands, alongside the Netherlands, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten. With an area spanning approximately 180 square kilometers, Aruba stands as a relatively small yet vibrant landmass within the region.

**Aruba experiences a tropical climate characterized by warm temperatures and relatively low rainfall.** The island is situated outside the main hurricane belt, which contributes to its lower susceptibility to direct hits from hurricanes. The climate is arid, with a constant trade wind that helps moderate the temperature and keep humidity levels relatively low. Average temperatures range between 27°C to 32°C (80°F to 90°F) throughout the year, fostering an environment conducive to tourism and outdoor activities.

**While Aruba has generally experienced a lower frequency of major disaster events compared to other Caribbean island peers, it is not entirely immune to various hazards.**

1.  Aruba's arid climate makes it vulnerable to drought, especially during extended periods of low rainfall. Water scarcity can impact agriculture productivity, local water supplies and availability, tourism, and overall livelihoods.
2.  Despite the low rainfall, Aruba can experience intense rainfall during short periods, leading to localized flash floods. Urban areas may be susceptible to drainage issues during heavy rains.
3.  Aruba's coastline is susceptible to erosion due to its exposure to the sea. Rising sea levels and increased storm surges associated with climate change can exacerbate coastal erosion, impacting infrastructure and settlements along the shore.

**The materialization of hazards has historically resulted in significant challenges and uncovered vulnerabilities** **to its socio-economic and environmental fabric.**

1.  *Droughts:* Aruba has experienced several drought periods, leading to water shortages and impacting agricultural activities and water resources.
2.  *Floods:* Intense rainfall events have caused localized flooding, particularly in urban areas with inadequate drainage systems.
3.  *Hurricane Impact:* While Aruba is less prone to direct hurricane hits, the island can still experience outer bands of tropical storms and hurricanes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season from June to November. These cyclones can bring heavy rains, strong winds, and storm surges that may lead to flooding, property damage, and disruptions to essential services. In 2007, Tropical Storm Felix brought heavy rainfall, flooding, and landslides to Aruba, resulting in infrastructure damage and the displacement of residents.
4.  *Coastal Erosion:* The island's coastline has experienced erosion, affecting beaches and coastal infrastructure.
5.  *Tsunamis:* Due to its proximity to the Caribbean Sea, which has been historically vulnerable to seismic activity. The island's flat terrain, while a unique feature, could render it susceptible to flooding in the event of a tsunami.
6.  *Tourism Disruptions:* While not a natural hazard, external factors like economic downturns or global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can disrupt Aruba's tourism-dependent economy.

**As Aruba continues to develop and thrive, the effective management of its susceptibility to natural hazards remains a critical consideration.** Investments in disaster preparedness, infrastructure resilience, and community engagement are vital components of the nation's strategy to mitigate the potential impacts of future hazard events. By aligning disaster risk reduction efforts with its unique geographical, climatic, and historical context, Aruba can enhance its overall resilience and ensure the safety and well-being of its population and assets.
