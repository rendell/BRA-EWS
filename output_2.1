1.	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The main objective of the Aruba EWS project Outcome 2 is to improve Aruba's capacity to support Comprehensive Disaster Management through the implementation of a Public Safety and Multi-hazard Early Warning System to help ensure there is minimal loss of life and property in a disaster or crisis. 

Prior to this project, in 2019 Aruba considered itself at a Capability Level O in their ability to provide adequate alert and warning to the public. Following the implementation of a VA/PA System, the consultants believe Aruba will be at a Capability Level 2, as defined by the following table:
 
Figure 1 - Warning Capabilities Matrix

The scope of this Outcome 2 project was to prepare a Terms of Reference for the Software Part of A VA/PA System, to prepare Technical Specifications for the Hardware Part Of A VA/PA System, and to draft an Optimization Study For An Integrated VA/PA System, taking into account common VA/PA solutions readily identified as existing and available on the general market.

The Main deliverable of this engagement is: EWS Output 2: An Optimization Study for integrating Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System.

When considering software for use with VA/PA systems, it is recommended, and supported per the TOR, that the integration method for the software be based on the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).  CAP is an international standard used as part of national systems to alert over 80% of the world’s population.  The standard is free and open, developed and maintained by OASIS OPEN https://youtu.be/5IsNdN8ohyk?feature=shared.  The International Telecom Union released an equivalent standard as their Recommendation X.1303.  Both the ITU and WMO promote CAP throughout the world.  It is the chosen standard for the new UN initiative Early Warnings for All https://public.wmo.int/en/earlywarningsforall. 

The CMO understands this important standard and how it can support integration with all early warning system (EWS) components.  In June 2023, the CMO hosted a weeklong training in CAP for CMO staff, Meteorological Department, Police, Fire, and Health. 

Figure 2 - CAP Workshop
Following the CAP Workshop, presented by the ICT/ Common Alerting Protocol Consultant, Eliot Christian, the IT/Telecom Specialist came on island to meet with the stakeholders from the Crisis Management Office (CMO), Communications providers, and Emergency Responders in June 2023. Field visits were facilitated by the CMO to potential sites for VA/PA systems, photos, data, and documents were also collected to inform this project. A second visit, in August 2023, enabled additional interviews, site visits, and documentation collection to inform the three project deliverables:

02.1: Drafted Terms of Reference for the Software Part of the Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System. 
02.2: Drafted Technical Specifications for the Hardware Part of the Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System.
02.3: Drafted Optimization Study for the integrating Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System. 
This report constitutes the deliverable for Output 02.1: Drafted Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Software Part of the Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System.

A presentation was provided to the CMO, as a part of the deliverables, to give an overview and context of the three primary deliverables.
 
2.	INTRODUCTION
2.1 Background and Context
Aruba is at risk of multiple hazards such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and tsunami, oil spills, and aircraft, or marine incidents. Aruba is classified at medium risk to tsunamis and as such, the impact of tsunamis should be considered for any activities located near the coast. Approximately 60% of Aruba's population lives in the coastal zone, and tourism accommodations and activities are concentrated on the southwest side of the island. While Hurricane Irma in 2017 did not hit Aruba directly, it caused large storm surges on the island and devastated nearby territories. Climate change may result in the increase in number or intensity of hurricanes and may also change their tracks. 

Due to these risks, and the need to notify the public, transient workers and guests to Aruba of actions to take in the event of an emergency or disaster, the Crisis Management Office (CMO) contracted with ThomasTechSolutions Consulting Services, LLC the end of June 2023 to prepare a Terms Of Reference For Software, Technical Specifications For Hardware, and an Optimization Study For An Integrated VA/PA System taking into account common VA/PA solutions identified as existing and available on the general market.

ThomasTechSolutions Consulting Services, LLC is well versed in developing recommendations for Terms of Reference (TOR) regarding alert and warning and has produced a significant number of procurement (bidding documents) and guidance documents as deliverables for clients, in the alert and warning, cell broadcast, telecommunications, disaster management and risk management sectors and it is a key area for our consulting business. We will leverage this experience to provide detailed Terms of Reference for the software part, Technical Specifications for the hardware part, and a draft Optimization Study for Integrating Voice Alarm and Public Address Systems.

Formerly of Anguilla, ThomasTechSolutions Consulting Services, LLC is a women and minority owned company whose staff have completed work previously in Aruba and 11 other Overseas Counties and Territories, specifically in the areas of Public Alert and Warning with the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP). CAP is an emergency communications standard used as part of national systems, to alert over 80% of the world’s population.  The standard is free and open and allows emergency messages to be simultaneously disseminated over a wide variety of existing and emerging public alerting systems. CAP is an international technical data specification developed and maintained by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS).   Both the ITU and WMO promote CAP throughout the world, and it is the chosen standard for the new UN initiative Early Warnings for All.

The CMO understands this important standard and how it can support integration with all early warning system (EWS) components.  In June 2023, the CMO hosted a weeklong training in CAP for CMO staff, Meteorological Department, Police, Fire, and Health. For reference, please see Figure 2 in the Executive Summary.
The IT/Telecom/CAP Specialist assigned by ThomasTechSolutions Consulting Services LLC for this project is the Chair of the OASIS CAP Committee.
This project and its recommendations will be based on the foundation of CAP whereas the EWS Aruba Terms of Reference state that “(Outcome 1.2 and 1.3) will be based on use of CAP, designated as International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Recommendation. CAP is the internationally agreed content standard for the format of alerts, applicable to all hazards and all media”. 

Prior to this project, Aruba considered itself at a Capability Level O with its ability to provide alert and warning to the public. Following the implementation of a VA/PA System, Aruba will be at a Capability Level 2, as defined in the Executive Summary above.

In summary, Aruba can be seen as an example for the entire Caribbean region in their development of Early Warning via this project and although Aruba and the other OCT’s may not be fully capable for alert and warning at a Capability 3, as few are, it is a continuing process of lessons learned, research into new technologies, retiring of old, implementing additional technologies, and continuing and improving stakeholder collaboration.  Aruba is to be commended for your efforts thus far toward building resilience and buying down risk from the hazards you face.
2.2 Objectives of the Project
The main objective of the Aruba EWS project is to improve Aruba's technological and human resource capacity to support Comprehensive Disaster Management through the implementation of a Public Safety and Multi-hazard Early Warning System to ensure there is minimal loss of life and property in a disaster or crisis. Aruba strives to advance its alert and warning capabilities to higher capability levels, laying groundwork for further advances in the future. The project would therefore support island-wide awareness and capacity enhancement for preparing and responding to crises by enabling the timely creation and dissemination of risk alerts and warnings.
2.2.1	Specific Objectives
The specific objective of this service contract was to provide an Optimization Study for Integrating Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System (Outcome 2). Outcome 2 had three (3) Outputs, namely:
02.1: Drafted Terms of Reference for the software part of the Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System. 
02.2: Drafted Technical Specifications for the hardware part of the Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System.
02.3: Drafted Optimization Study for the integrating Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System. 

This report constitutes the deliverable for Output 02.1: Drafted Terms of Reference for the software part of the Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System.
2.2.1.1	General Project Components 
As stated, there were three (3) primary deliverables (Outputs) for the Outcome 2 project. This report speaks to Output 02.1 Drafted Terms of Reference for the Software Part of the Voice Alarm & Public Address (VA/PA) System. The following tasks were performed that are related to Output 02.2:
3.	CAP WORKSHOP
The CAP workshop was held just prior to the start of this project.  Responders attended the workshop hosted by CMO and led by Mr. Eliot Christian. For reference, please see Figure 2 in the executive summary.
3.1 Outcome of CAP Workshop and Decisions Made on EWS
The outcome of the workshop was to learn how CAP can most effectively and inexpensively be used to compose, authorize and issue alerts for Aruba.  The following decisions on administrative governance were made:
1.	The cloud-based CAP Editor freeware is used to create and publish CAP alerts, in four languages: Papiamento, Dutch, Spanish, and English. (CAP Editor also in use at Curaçao Met Department and in testing at Sint Maarten Met Office.)
2.	Five Aruba Alerting Authorities jointly publish an all-of-government CAP feed:
Crisis Management Office, Met Department, Police, Fire, Health
3.	The CAP Feed is named: Alerts Aruba (English), Waarschuwing Aruba (Dutch), 
Alerta Aruba (Papiamento), Alertas Aruba (Spanish)
4.	Each alerting authority head designates its own Composers and Approvers, 
and Rino communicates updates to Eliot (admin of the CAP Editor tool)
5.	Each Alerting Authority uses its own “sender” name and address in its CAP alerts. These need to be active e-mail services that handle public inquiries.
6.	Alerts Aruba will be entered in the international Register of Alerting Authorities under the Netherlands (country code 528) by the Permanent Representative 
of the Netherlands with WMO: Gerard Van Der Steenhoven
7.	Initially, the existing multi-language Caribbean headline/description/instruction templates will be used as text sources for Aruba CAP alerts. Other reference materials (favorite CAP alerts, commonly used polygons...) will be placed somewhere easily accessible to all Aruba Composers and Approvers. 
8.	Interaction with regional actors such as CDEMA will be explored as needed.
9.	Each Aruba Alerting Authority will begin analyzing how best to incorporate CAP alert publishing in its Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
10.	The five Aruba Alerting Authorities will come to consensus as to which dissemination media, in addition to the RSS feed, are of highest priority 
(e.g., sirens, mobile phones, radio, television, social media…) for their needs. 

4.	REVIEW AVAILABLE VA/PA SOFTWARE
The consultant reviewed available software for Alert and Warning Dissemination, which can reach the vulnerable community via VA/PA systems.  Given the topology in Aruba, certain systems will work well in the environment.  

This review only includes systems that have the required software interface for CAP and the Aruba EWS.  It is important that any system is integrated to provide a holistic warning capability for Aruba. The CAP interface is very important for the foundation of an integrated public alert and warning system.

The following table summarizes the Literature Desk Review elements.

5.	STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS & SITE VISITS


This project began with a kickoff meeting with the CMO, the week following the CAP workshop.  Meetings were held with CMO Director and staff to relay the mission and goal of the organization and the need for the VA/PA system. 
 
5.1 Stakeholder Meetings
The responders included CMO, Fire, Police, Meteorological Department (Meteo), Health.   Having just completed the CAP workshop, attendees were encouraged to continue to use it for sending messages to one another to get used to the CAP tool provided during the workshop.

Responders (fire) discussed the major hazards for which a CAP based system could be used.  Flash flood is a major concern especially in Orangestadt and Palm Beach areas which are the lowest.
Currently there is no public alerting in place on the island.  Responders mostly use cell phones even though coverage could be better.  They use WhatsApp to communicate with one another.

The responders recommended regular siren tests on the same day and time to get the population used to hearing it.

Responders (police) stated the need to advise when a road will be closed so emergency vehicles can reroute.  Currently they use WhatsApp and Facebook.

None of the responders have access to Sat Phones.  SETAR has satellite phones and provides them to some of the hotels.

Meteo offered that there is one rain gauge at the airport, but all notices come from Curaçao via radar.  This shows weather coming but often dissipates before getting here.

 






Figure 5 - 28 June 2023 Responder Stakeholder Meeting Participants  
 
Figure 6 - 28 June 2023 Responder Stakeholder Meeting Participants
It was discussed that there are areas of the island that cannot be reached by Internet and mobile communications.  
SETAR provides internet and is a mobile operator.  Digicel is also a mobile operator on the island.  

The responders suggested the need to also be concerned about the south end of the island regarding alerting and especially the national park which has little to no coverage. Participants mentioned that Radio Holland which is now “C3” recently did a test on the southeast part of island.  They were successfully able to relay using their radio system.  Perhaps this could be a backup for other communication services in a disaster.   About Us - C3 - Critical Communication Caribbean  
5.1.1.	Communications
The ability to provide a reliable VA/PA system is dependent on critical communications. The second stakeholder meeting included the regulator, both mobile operators and the internet provider. 

SETAR provides all Internet service for Aruba is a mobile operator, and partially government owned.  SETAR is the only internet on the island as well as providing off island sea cables.  Aruba has two sea cables with landing points on both the north and south ends of the island.  They connect with two separate locations in the US, Miami and Jacksonville, FL.  With this redundancy, it is acceptable to rely on cloud-based services to support the critical mission of the CMO.  

According to the CMO, the activation of EWS will have the highest priority for access on the Internet.
Digicel is a mobile operator in Aruba, and other parts of the world.  They lease space on the sea cables from SETAR. DTZ is the regulator of communications in Aruba.  DTZ touched on Cell Broadcast, however communications to support a siren system is the main focus of this project.
5.2 Field Site Visits
The onsite consultant met with Aruba EWS Project Manager and team to organize schedules, field visits, and interviews. The consultant performed the following tasks while on island:
•	Field Visits towards Outcome 2 Outputs,
•	Collected documentation related to VA/PA Systems current and/or proposed,
•	Held Interviews related to VA/PA Systems,
•	Documented investigations into VA/PA Systems, and
•	Initiated documentation for Technical Specifications for Software Part

There were two on-site meetings for this project, one in June and one in August 2023.  During the June meeting, CMO staff escorted ThomasTechSolutions Consulting Services, LLC to the possible sites for VA/PA system installations. 

 
Figure 7 - Reference map showing layout of the Island.
 Pictures were taken of the potential locations for VA/PA recommended site locations and are documented in 02.2 Technical Specifications for Hardware part of VA/PA System. It is anticipated that 6 sites will initially be installed and operational by March 14, 2024.  An additional 6 sites may be considered as part of a follow-on effort.

During the August on-site meeting, ThomasTechSolutions Consulting Services, LLC visited additional sites that could be considered to reach the general population. The high point at (Arikok) was considered as a possible location for a VA/PA System, however, the backup for Arikok is not sufficient and would not likely reach the local population in the area.

The consultant met with C3 Communications (formerly Radio Holland) to learn of their capabilities and the testing they did in the difficult areas on the island.  The representative recounted a test that was performed and proved the use of C3 radio hardware to act as a relay and get RF to the other side of Arikok.  This relay mechanism should be considered for back up for this hard-to-reach area.

The locations visited included the lighthouse, high-rise hotel area, low-rise hotel area, the port, the main fire station and are documented in 02.2 Technical Specifications for Hardware part of VA/PA System.

 
6.	THE VA/PA SOFTWARE SPECIFICATIONS
6.1 EWS Proposed System Architecture
 
Figure 8 - Proposed System Architecture for Aruba

The EWS Architecture shown in Figure 4, identifies how the VA/PA System is integrated into an overall all hazards alert and warning system.

At the center of Figure 4 is the filtered alert hub (FAH) where alerts are posted and pulled to activate various dissemination methods.

The areas in light orange identify future integration possibilities.  On the left are sources of alerts and on the right the dissemination methods.

In the case of sirens there are two paths both utilizing the reliable internet capability to site locations in Aruba.  

The siren system provided shall be activated by a CAP message posted directly to the siren control point as well as posted to the FAH for retrieval by both siren and other dissemination methods for activation of alerts and messages.

The proposed VA/PA Hardware Part of the VA/PA System for Aruba is shown as a part of Figure 4, Proposed System Architecture for Aruba, and the components are listed and described in section 3 of this report.  
Specific requirements follow in the paragraphs below preceded by a bullet and use the imperative “shall” language, which is in bold font, to guide potential bidders of the system on minimal procurement requirements. It is important that any system is integrated to provide a holistic warning capability for Aruba.  
Currently, there are no outdoor waring systems on the island of Aruba.

6.2 Software Specification 
6.2.1 Key Elements of CAP Based Alerting System
6.2.1.2	Alert Origination
Appropriate alerting authorities must originate a CAP message with a software tool. 

The CAP workshop provided the necessary training for the responders that will be authoring, composing and issuing alerts. Following on from the decisions made at the CAP workshop and noting the strong supportive off-island communications infrastructure, the “free” CAP editor is an effective, reliable and sensible approach to generating CAP alerts.  It provides all the necessary capabilities needed. Therefore, it is recommended that the software to be used for originating alerts for Aruba should be the free CAP editor tool.  There is no initial or recurring charge for this tool.6.2.2 Overarching Requirements
6.2.1.3     Alert Aggregation:
CAP Alerts are stored in a database.

Alerts are stored in various types of aggregators or alert hubs.  Also, with access to highly reliable communication infrastructure off island and high priority internet for CMO alerting on island, it is recommended that the free Filtered Alert Hub (FAH) be used for storing alerts.  The method of storing CAP alerts in the FAH is using the RSS feed.  By doing so, the validated alerting authority can post an alert as you might a newspaper article.  In this way, it is a public post, and it is not necessary for any legal or regulatory approvals to be obtained.  The FAH does not reside on an island and can be accessed through the highly redundant sea cable infrastructure for both posting and pulling alerts.  There is no initial or recurring charge for the FAH.
6.2.1.4 Alert Dissemination 
Alerts are sent to designated recipients using a variety of methods.
Organizations select based on their local situation which alerts are sent using a variety of methods, e.g., radio, TV, Facebook, Websites and specifically in this case, VA/PA systems – like sirens.  When it comes to the methods for dissemination, different entities must be involved.  Fortunately, for the VA/PA system using Internet to communicate to and from the sites does not require any radio frequency allocation or other approvals.  The CMO intends to identify rooftop sites that will be made available and have existing power.  
Considering the three portions of the alerting process and with a background and understanding of the communications infrastructure, the following software requirements for the VA/PA system can be articulated.

7.	SUMMARY CONCLUSION
A centralized format for encapsulating all alerts and warnings is an important component of a national alert and warning system.  Aruba has chosen the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) as the standard about which the Aruba EWS is centered.  This provides an excellent foundation for an integrated public alert and warning system.  With this foundation, many input devices (flood detection, wind devices, rain gauges, e.g.) can be integrated on the front end of the alerting process.  

It is best to save the alert (CAP) message in its raw XML format or in a well-established and well known publicly accessible format, such as an RSS feed.  By making this “public” statement of an alert, you have basically posted it in the newspaper in a familiar news-feed format to be distributed in a variety of ways.  You also bypass detailed regulatory and legislative issues as this is an authorized public message.

Many systems on the market today use CAP to originate alerts and warnings.  That is great news!  There are also many output devices that are becoming CAP “complaint” by using CAP to activate smoke alarms, social media, websites and VA/PA systems to name a few.  However, the VA/PA systems studies will accept a CAP message. That means the VA/PA system would have to “post” the message to the siren control unit.  That meets the requirement for CAP activation.

These requirements provide for the VA/PA system to pull the CAP message (which is stored as an RSS feed) at the filtered alert hub (FAH).  If the provider can satisfy this requirement as well, it would be an advantage.  However, they will not be disqualified if they cannot.
